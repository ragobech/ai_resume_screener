# AI Interview Panel

Steps for How the Interview Panel Logic Will Work
Below is an enumeration of steps to explain how the AI interview panel logic will work when integrating the agents and APIs. This process assumes that each agent is encapsulated in its own Python file and the orchestration logic is served through an API using FastAPI.

## Step 1: Set Up Candidate Data
Action: Collect candidate data (e.g., resume, cover letter, or inputted answers) which will be provided to each agent.
Implementation: Store the candidate data in a structured format (e.g., a dictionary, JSON, or read from a file).

## Step 2: Trigger the HR Agent
Action: The first agent (HR agent) will receive the candidate’s information and ask initial screening questions.
Logic:
Example questions: "What is your career goal?", "What is your expected salary?"
Uses LangChain and OpenAI to generate responses.
Implementation: hr_agent.py processes the data and returns a response.

## Step 3: Hiring Manager's Technical Evaluation
Action: After the HR agent completes, the Hiring Manager agent evaluates the candidate’s technical skills.
Logic:
Example questions: "Describe your experience with microservices," "How would you troubleshoot a distributed system?"
Uses LangChain and prompts focused on the candidate's technical experience.
Implementation: The response from the HR agent is passed to hiring_manager_agent.py.

## Step 4: Developer Agent Coding Assessment
Action: The Developer agent takes the candidate's technical response and assesses coding proficiency.
Logic:
Example question: "What coding languages are you proficient in?", "Explain how you would implement a binary search algorithm."
Depending on the response, the agent can delve deeper with technical coding or logic questions.
Implementation: Use developer_agent.py for this step.

## Step 5: Leadership Agent for Team Collaboration Assessment
Action: After technical evaluation, the Leadership agent assesses how the candidate fits into the team and handles interpersonal challenges.
Logic:
Example questions: "Describe how you handle conflict in a team?", "How do you promote collaboration and mentorship?"
Implementation: leadership_agent.py handles leadership and collaboration questions.

## Step 6: CEO Agent for Long-Term Vision and Mission Fit
Action: The CEO agent evaluates the candidate’s alignment with the company’s mission, vision, and long-term contributions.
Logic:
Example questions: "Where do you see yourself contributing to our mission?", "What excites you about our future direction?"
The agent assesses how well the candidate's values align with company goals.
Implementation: ceo_agent.py processes the final evaluation.

## Step 7: Compile Responses from All Agents
Action: The orchestrator collects responses from all agents (HR, Hiring Manager, Developer, Leadership, CEO) and compiles them into a final report.
Logic:
The responses from each agent are combined into a structured format (e.g., JSON) to create an overall evaluation summary.
Optionally, scoring mechanisms can be added to provide a quantitative evaluation.
Implementation: Orchestrator logic in orchestrator.py.

## Step 8: Deliver Final Evaluation Report
Action: The final report is sent back to the hiring team for review. This can be done either via an API response or stored in a database.
Logic:
The final report can include scores, strengths, weaknesses, and overall fit.
Implementation:
API response if using FastAPI or output to console if using Click for a CLI tool.
Example High-Level Flow
Collect candidate data (e.g., from an API request or CLI input).

1. Run HR agent: Ask candidate broad screening questions.
2. Run Hiring Manager agent: Dive into technical skills.
3. Run Developer agent: Assess coding knowledge.
4. Run Leadership agent: Evaluate team and conflict management skills.
5. Run CEO agent: Assess cultural fit and alignment with the company’s mission.
6. Compile final report from all agents’ responses.


7.  Deliver the report to the hiring team for decision-making.

By following this plan, you will create a modular AI interview panel system where each step in the process is handled by a separate agent, allowing for clean and organized execution of the interview logic.
